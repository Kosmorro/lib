## Using the Kosmorrolib

The Kosmorrolib provides three functions that you can use in your code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import kosmorrolib
from datetime import date

position = kosmorrolib.Position(50.5824, 3.0624)

# Get the moon phase for today
moon_phase = kosmorrolib.get_moon_phase()

# Get the moon phase for June 9th, 2021
moon_phase = kosmorrolib.get_moon_phase(date.fromisoformat('2021-06-09'))

# Get a list of objects representing the ephemerides of today.
ephemerides = kosmorrolib.get_ephemerides(position)

# Get a list of objects representing the ephemerides of June 9th, 2021.
ephemerides = kosmorrolib.get_ephemerides(position, date.fromisoformat('2021-06-09'))

# Get a list of objects representing the events of today.
events = kosmorrolib.get_events()

# Get a list of objects representing the events on June 9th, 2021.
events = kosmorrolib.get_events(date.fromisoformat('2021-06-09'))

# Note that each method provides an optional parameter for the timezone:
moon_phase = kosmorrolib.get_moon_phase(timezone=2)
ephemerides = kosmorrolib.get_ephemerides(position, timezone=2)
events = kosmorrolib.get_events(timezone=2)
```
