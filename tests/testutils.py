def expect_assertions(assert_fun, num=1):
    """Asserts that an assertion function is called as expected.

    This is very useful when the assertions are in loops.
    To use it, create a nested function in the the tests function.
    The nested function will receive as parameter the mocked assertion function to use in place of the original one.
    Finally, run the nested function.

    Example of use:

    >>> # the function we tests:
    >>> def my_sum_function(n, m):
    >>>     # some code here
    >>>     pass

    >>> # The unit tests:
    >>> def test_sum(self):
    >>>     @expect_assertions(self.assertEqual, num=10):
    >>>     def make_assertions(assert_equal):
    >>>         for i in range (-5, 5):
    >>>             for j in range(-5, 5):
    >>>                 assert_equal(i + j, my_sum_function(i, j)
    >>>
    >>>     make_assertions()  # You don't need to give any parameter, the decorator does it for you.
